## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
*   **Node.js:** [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
*   **npm** is installed with Node.js.
*   **Yarn (Optional):** [Install Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    [git clone https://github.com/Gulshancr12/AnimePremi.git
    cd AnimePremi
    ```
2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or if you prefer Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Set up Environment Variables (if any):**
    If your project requires API keys or other environment variables (e.g., for a real anime database API or your Formspree endpoint if you don't want to hardcode it), create a `.env` file in the root directory and add them:
    ```env
    REACT_APP_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    REACT_APP_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT=YOUR_FORMSPREE_URL_HERE 
    # (Remember to replace YOUR_FORMSPREE_URL_HERE in Contact.jsx if hardcoded)
    ```
    *Note: The `REACT_APP_` prefix is necessary for Create React App to expose variables to your frontend code.*

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    Or with Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```
    This will open the app in your default browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.
